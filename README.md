# Plan It
Full-stack app for anyone to plan an event, invite others to help with planning, 
such bring items to the event, or volunteer at the event. Users can login to the account, create an event with event location, date, time. 
They can add items for people to bring to the event, or ask for help with volunteering. 

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML/CSS, TailwindCSS, EJS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Passport for Authentication

## Inspiration:
My kid's sports team has events and parents help bring items and volunteer. There seemed to be a lack of easy to use tools with a clean UI. 
A lot of times parents create a text message with a list of things needed for the event and event information and have other respond to it with what they can bring or volunteer.
I thought it would be nice to have an App to keep it organized.

## Optimizations:
- Customize volunteer opportunities
- Create an option to print list of items
- Send an invite to people invited to the event
- Set up reminders before the event
- An option to find an event
